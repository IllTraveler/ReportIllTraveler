# Ill Traveler
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is tasked with safeguarding the public health of the United States by preventing the entry and spread of communicable diseases from foreign countries within the U.S. For diseases that have been specially designated by the U.S. President, the CDC can issue federal public health orders for quarantine, isolation, and conditional release. This specific federal public health authority (Table 8-03) covers diseases such as cholera, diphtheria, infectious tuberculosis, measles, plague, smallpox, yellow fever, viral hemorrhagic fevers, severe acute respiratory syndromes (like Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS] and coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]), and influenza caused by novel or reemerging viruses that could potentially cause a pandemic.

CDC conducts public health actions before, during, and after commercial flights and cruise travel to prevent or mitigate the introduction and spread of diseases of public health concern. A report of an ill traveler at involves a comprehensive account of a traveler's health status, symptoms, and potential exposure to infectious diseases. It is essential for disease surveillance and control, especially in preventing the spread of diseases across borders. The report may include the traveler's personal details, travel history, health history, clinical results, and recommended public health actions. It aids DGMH in implementing appropriate health measures, such as treatment, quarantine, or health advisories, to protect the individual and their community.
