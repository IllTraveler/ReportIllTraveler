# Electronic Case Reporting

The Electronic Case Reporting (eCR) standards; the electronic Initial Case Report (eICR) and the Reportability Response (RR), support two broad approaches to eCR.

One of the approaches also uses the Reportable Condition Knowledge Management System (RCKMS) on the AIMS platform to report to Public Health Agencies (PHAs) and one does not. The two approaches are:

Information flowing from healthcare to PHAs (via the eICR) and back (via the RR) after a reportability determination has been made at the healthcare organization using reporting rules from all PHAs for all conditions.
Information flowing from healthcare to a shared services platform (via the eICR) and then to PHAs (via the eICR and the RR) and with a response to healthcare from the shared services platform (via the RR).
In some jurisdictions, HIEs and/or Health Information Networks may also be employed to securely move data between organizations including to and from a shared services platform.

Prominent among these purposes is to implement public health reporting rules that cannot currently be readily distributed to healthcare. The rules ensure that public health agencies only get the data they are authorized to receive by state laws.

Without more complex reporting rules that are distributable to, and executable in, healthcare most PHAs will not use approach #1. Hence, these approaches are principally represented by either “Remote Rules” or “Local Rules” in the following diagram.
