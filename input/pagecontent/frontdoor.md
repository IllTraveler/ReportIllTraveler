# CDC DGMQ Report of Ill Traveler & CDC Front Door
The CDC DGMQ Report of Ill Traveler Implementation Guide is designed to be easily integrated into the CDC front door upon reaching sufficient maturity.
 
# What is the CDC Front Door?
The CDC Front Door is a single point of entry that the public health community can use to send data, as-is, to CDC. This digital tool can be used by CDC and public health partners at state, tribal, local, and territorial (STLT) levels. In the future, this tool will allow for data exchange in both directions.

The CDC Front Door is one element of the North Star Architecture, which is our blueprint for a sustainable, response-ready public health ecosystem. This new blueprint is guiding CDC in the development of shared datasets and readily available tools to enable better, faster, more actionable insights at all levels of public health.

# Problems the CDC Front Door will help solve
Today, reporting different public health conditions to CDC can be a difficult and time-consuming process.

* There are many ways for data to enter CDC and often the processes and technical requirements vary from one entryway to another.
* When data submitters send data to CDC, sometimes it is not clear if the transfer was successful or not.
* Once data is received by programs, additional steps are needed to store data and prepare the data for analysis. Many CDC programs handle these steps differently, and some processes are done manually.
The CDC Front Door is designed to:

* Standardize and streamline how data is submitted to CDC
* Accept multiple data formats (e.g., HL7v2, FHIR, CSV), data types and sources (e.g., lab, case, hospital) for any amount of data.
* Keep data secure by using modern APIs that make sure data are transferred safely and accessed only by approved users.
* Track data status by providing automatic updates on data transfer progress to data submitters and CDC programs. Senders and receivers will know if there are problems with data submission in near real time.
* Make data available faster to approved CDC programs for storage and analysis within minutes after it is submitted.
# How the CDC Front Door can help public health
Overall, the CDC Front Door makes data reporting easier and faster by reducing the number of locations where data is submitted to CDC and providing more flexibility on the ways the data can be formatted. It also uses technology that supports a near real-time data feedback loop.
